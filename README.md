# Brew Exchange

[View the deployed site here.](https://ms3-brew-exchange.herokuapp.com/)

Brew Exchange is a website where users can share their coffee recipes with the specialty coffee community, and can access recipes from other members of the community. This website was created for submission as my Milestone Project 3 as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute.<br><br>
With a large variety of brewing equipment, coffee varieties, and brewing methods, users can search for recipes that suit the coffee or brewing equipment that they have. This site advances the ther user's goals by providing CRUD functionality to the coffee recipes database. It advances the site owner's goals by being a regular user of the site themselves.
